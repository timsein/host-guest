# Stationery Suites — Product Shot

## Subject Prompt

A flat lay of a letterpress stationery suite arranged on a textured linen surface. A thick cotton invitation card with deep-pressed terracotta ink sits at the center, slightly overlapping a smaller menu card in forest green ink on cream cardstock. A delicate place card with hand-lettered calligraphy in aged gold leans against a small ceramic dish. A folded thank-you note with a torn deckled edge is tucked underneath, partially visible. Around the edges: a brass wax seal stamp, a spool of natural twine, a dried olive branch, and a vintage fountain pen with its cap off. Everything has texture — the deep letterpress impression visible in the paper, the weave of the linen underneath, the patina on the brass. Soft diffused daylight from directly above with just enough angle to catch the shadows in the pressed type.

## Film + Edit Prompt

High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.
