# Gift Boxes — Product Shot

## Subject Prompt

An open curated gift box shot from above at a slight angle, nestled in torn tissue paper the color of aged parchment. The box itself is a deep forest green rigid stock with a subtle debossed logo. Inside, items are layered with intention: a small hand-poured beeswax candle in a raw ceramic vessel, a bundle of hand-dyed sage linen cocktail napkins tied with waxed leather cord, a brass bottle opener with a patinated finish, a small jar of wildflower honey with a hand-stamped label, and a letterpress card in terracotta ink tucked along the side. A few dried orange slices and a sprig of dried rosemary are scattered between the items as filler. The box sits on a weathered marble surface with warm veining. Beside it, the lid is propped casually against the box, a few loose pomegranate seeds and a torn piece of brown kraft wrapping paper nearby as if someone just started unwrapping. The whole scene feels like a gift that was assembled by hand with thought behind every piece — not shrink-wrapped, not corporate, not generic. Warm late afternoon light from the left casting soft golden shadows across the marble and catching the brass and the honey jar.

## Film + Edit Prompt
