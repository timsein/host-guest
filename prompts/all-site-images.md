## HOMEPAGE

**Offerings Panel — Events** (3:4 vertical)
PROMPT: A dinner table set in a simple backyard at golden hour, shot at 35mm f/2.8 from the end of the table looking down its length. The table is colorful — a deep rust-orange table runner, vintage painted plates in mismatched blues and greens, amber and green glass tumblers, taper candles in jewel-toned ceramic holders, a big bowl of bright citrus as the centerpiece. Cloth napkins in mustard yellow tied with dried lavender. The setting is a normal yard — a wooden fence, string lights strung overhead, a garden hose coiled in the corner, grass that needs mowing. Six friends seated, one mid-sentence leaning forward, another pouring wine without looking at the glass, someone else resting their chin on their hand. A dish being passed. No one is posing. The contrast is the point: the table is vibrant and intentional, the yard is just a yard. Golden hour light raking across the table. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Offerings Panel — Products** (3:4 vertical)
PROMPT: A close-up of a curated product shelf in warm morning light, shot at 85mm f/1.8. A mix of textures and finishes — a matte black ceramic bowl stacked inside a speckled cream one, folded linen napkins in sage and a deep plum, a hand-poured candle in a ribbed amber glass vessel, a small wooden box with the lid ajar showing letterpress cards inside, a terracotta pot holding dried eucalyptus. A vintage brass dish holds a beeswax taper and a box of matches. The shelf is simple wood but the objects draw you in — varied, tactile, each one different from the last. Shot tight with shallow depth of field so the front objects are sharp and the back falls into soft warmth. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Offerings Panel — Workshops** (3:4 vertical)
PROMPT: A workshop in progress in a light-filled space, shot at 50mm f/2.4 at eye level — a bright community room or someone's open living area. A group of people around a table, hands working — one folding a cloth napkin into a rosette, another painting a small watercolor place card, another pressing dried flowers onto a card with wax. Materials spread across the table: fabric in jewel tones and earth tones, watercolor pans, brushes in a jar of water, dried florals, wax sticks, stamps, ink pads. People in casual clothes, absorbed in what they're doing. One person holding up their work to compare with their neighbor's. Someone's head is tilted, concentrating. No one is looking at the camera. Natural window light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Offerings Panel — Tablescapes** (3:4 vertical)
PROMPT: A single place setting shot at 85mm f/1.6 from a low angle at table level, looking across the surface. A deep cobalt blue ceramic plate on a woven jute placemat, a saffron-colored linen napkin folded into a loose knot with a sprig of fresh thyme tucked in. A vintage silver fork and knife. A small colored glass votive — amber — glowing softly. A handwritten name card on kraft paper. The table surface is painted wood, slightly chipped, with character. The depth of field is extremely shallow — the thyme is sharp, the votive behind dissolves into warm color. Warm side light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Products Highlight 1 — Table Collection** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: An overhead shot at 35mm f/4 of a table collection arrangement on a weathered wooden surface. A stack of handmade ceramic plates — one charcoal, one cream, one terracotta — slightly offset. Beside them: cloth napkins in indigo and sage, a pair of wooden salad servers, a small stoneware pitcher, two taper candles in contrasting holders — one ceramic, one copper. A cutting board with a torn pomegranate adds a shock of red. A small bowl of flaky salt. Grouped naturally, slightly overlapping, not precious. Shot directly above. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Products Highlight 2 — Stationery Suites** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: A flat lay shot at 50mm f/3.5 of letterpress stationery on textured linen. A thick cotton invitation with deep-pressed terracotta ink, a menu card in forest green, a name card with hand-lettered calligraphy in aged gold. The paper has torn deckled edges and visible press texture. A brass wax seal, a spool of twine, and a vintage pen with cap off sit nearby. The stationery is beautiful and tactile — the setting is simple. Warm diffused daylight. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Products Highlight 3 — Gift Boxes** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: A curated gift box half-open on a table, shot at 50mm f/2.8. Parchment tissue paper spilling out. Deep green box with beautiful contents: a hand-poured candle in a ridged amber glass jar, linen napkins tied with cord, a jar of honey with a hand-stamped label, a letterpress note card. A small wooden spoon and dried orange slices scattered beside. The table surface is lived-in — a coffee mug at the edge of frame, a set of keys. The gift is clearly high quality; the moment is casual and real. Warm afternoon light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## ABOUT PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 60vh)
PROMPT: A wide landscape shot at 24mm f/5.6 of a long dinner table set outdoors on a grassy hillside at golden hour. The table stretches across the frame — a simple wooden table covered with a striped linen runner in cream and terracotta. The settings are eclectic: vintage patterned plates in different designs, colored glassware in greens and ambers, pillar candles on wooden slabs, small potted succulents between place settings, cloth napkins in different solid colors at each seat. Chairs are a mix — wooden, folding, a bench. The hillside slopes away behind, trees silhouetted against the golden sky. No guests yet — just the table and the landscape. The scale of the open land against the intimacy of each place setting. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Origin Story Image** (3:4 portrait)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.8, overhead. Hands tucking a small handwritten card into a folded napkin beside a plate, seen from above. The napkin is a warm rust color. The plate is simple white with a hand-painted blue rim. A glass jar with a single garden rose — slightly blown open, petals loose — sits nearby. Around the edges: a water glass, the corner of a wooden tray with sliced bread. The table is simple wood. The image is about the gesture — someone taking a quiet moment to make another person feel welcome. Warm natural light from a window. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## EVENTS PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 60vh)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 28mm f/2.8 of a dinner party in full swing at a long outdoor table at dusk. Moroccan-style lanterns hanging from tree branches overhead, mixed with string lights. The table is layered and colorful — a patterned textile runner, stoneware bowls with bright harissa and saffron-colored dips, flatbreads piled on wooden boards, pomegranate scattered like confetti. Colored glass tea lights in cobalt and amber dot the table. Plates are mix-and-match — some solid, some patterned. Eight to ten people. One person mid-sentence with their hands up telling a story. Someone across the table with their head thrown back. Another quietly refilling their neighbor's glass. The light is that blue-gold transition where the lanterns start to glow. Shot from one end. No one aware of the camera. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Intimate Dinner Parties** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Six friends around a table in a cozy dining room, shot at 35mm f/2.4 slightly above seated eye level. The table is set with character — white plates layered on woven placemats, a big wooden bowl of pasta in the center steaming, mismatched wine glasses — one person drinking from a tumbler. Candles in different vessels: a tall taper in a wine bottle with wax dripped down the neck, a small votive in a colored glass cup, a pillar candle on a saucer. A vase of grocery store flowers — peonies or dahlias — still in their paper wrapping, propped in a pitcher. It's a real room — bookshelves, art on the walls, a lamp. One person gesturing mid-thought, another leaning back with a glass, someone reaching across for bread. A napkin has fallen on the floor. Warm mix of candlelight and overhead light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Weddings & Celebrations** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A wedding dinner at a long table under mature trees, shot at 35mm f/4 slightly elevated. Paper lanterns and string lights woven through the branches. The table is stunning but unfussy — a natural linen runner, hand-painted ceramic plates in soft pink and cream, vintage mismatched silverware, small bud vases with single stems — a ranunculus here, a garden rose there, a sprig of jasmine. Hand-lettered name cards on seed paper. Colored glass votives in blush and gold cast warm light. The ground is grass. A kid mid-run behind the table, blurred. Someone's jacket draped over a chair. A three-tier cake covered in fresh fruit — not fondant — on a wooden stand. Golden hour fading to dusk. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Corporate Events & Retreats** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A team gathered in a warm, light-filled space shot at 40mm f/3.5 — a bright loft with big windows. People around a long table with both work materials and hospitality details: notebooks and pens alongside ceramic mugs in different glazes, a carafe of water with cucumber and mint, small succulents in terracotta pots at each place. The table is simple birch or light wood. Each seat has a cloth napkin in olive green and a small welcome card. A bowl of clementines and a plate of pastries on a wooden board in the center. One person standing at the end with a marker, mid-thought. Someone writing without looking up. Another with arms crossed, processing. A half-eaten pastry on someone's notebook. Natural light and warm interior light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Conferences & Gatherings** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A large gathering shot at 28mm f/4, elevated angle, in a character-filled space — a renovated barn or a bright community room with high ceilings. Tables in clusters covered with simple white cloths. Each place has a ceramic mug, a small wrapped gift in kraft paper with a stamped wax seal, and a handwritten name tag on colored cardstock — each a different color. A refreshment station: a vintage table with a copper urn for coffee, baked goods on tiered wooden stands, a fruit bowl, and a chalkboard menu sign. Seasonal branches in a tall ceramic floor vase. People mid-arrival — someone reading their name tag, another holding a coffee cup with both hands, two people in a side conversation near the window. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Related Card — Products** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A tight shot at 85mm f/1.8 of product details on a shelf — a matte black ceramic bowl, folded plum linen, a glowing candle in amber glass, a small copper dish. Beautiful objects, shallow depth of field, varied materials. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Related Card — Workshops** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.8. Hands working at a workshop table — mid-fold on linen, a brush painting a watercolor card, fingers pressing a dried flower into wax. Close crop on the hands and materials only. No faces. Warm light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Related Card — Tablescapes** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 85mm f/1.6. A single place setting shot close — a cobalt plate on a woven mat, a saffron napkin with a thyme sprig, a handwritten card on kraft paper. Everything behind melts into warm bokeh. A colored glass votive glowing. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## WORKSHOPS PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 60vh)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 24mm f/3.5 of a workshop around a large table in a beautiful, light-filled space — a sunroom, a bright studio, a restaurant cleared for the day. People working with their hands — one person dyeing fabric in a shallow tray of indigo, another hand-stamping a pattern onto a napkin, another arranging dried flowers into a small vessel. Materials across the table: fabrics in different colors and textures, dye pots, stamps, ink, dried florals, ribbon, watercolors. The space has big windows and warm walls. One person squinting at their work, another looking over at what someone else made. Someone's hand resting on the table, pausing. Coffee cups and water glasses mixed with paint-stained supplies. No one is performing — they're in it. Warm natural light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Team Hospitality Training** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.8, candid. A facilitator demonstrating a table setting for a small group. Their hands are folding a bright marigold-colored napkin into a fan shape on a speckled ceramic plate. Four or five people watch from around the table. One person scribbling a note without looking at their paper. Another holding their own napkin, trying to follow along. Someone leaning on their elbows watching closely. The table has examples at each place — different napkin folds, different colored textiles, small potted herbs as gifts. Coffee in varied ceramic mugs and a box of pastries nearby — someone mid-bite. The space is bright and warm. Natural light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Industry-Specific Workshops** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 85mm f/2, tight detail. A close-up of hands comparing fabric swatches and material samples on a workshop table. Torn inspiration images, dried botanicals, color swatches ranging from deep burgundy to pale peach to forest green. Handwritten notes on index cards. Small samples of different textures: linen, raw silk, cotton, burlap. A mood board leans against the wall in the background, soft and out of focus. A ceramic cup of tea and reading glasses at the edge. The hands are actively working — holding two fabrics side by side, deciding. Warm natural light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Leadership Retreats** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 35mm f/2.8 with a through-a-doorway feel. A small group around a table on an open porch with views to trees and hills. The table is set simply but with warmth — a wooden tray of charcuterie with bright pickled vegetables and honeycomb, a ceramic pitcher of water with lemon, small colored glass tumblers in smoky blue and amber, cloth napkins in a deep olive. Notebooks and pens scattered among the food. One person speaking with their pen in hand. Someone across the table looking down at their notes, thinking. Another resting their chin on their fist. A water glass being reached for. The setting is between casual and elevated — a retreat house, a nice Airbnb. Warm late afternoon light through trees. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — The Art of the Table** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Overhead shot at 35mm f/5.6, flat lay style. Four wildly different place settings side by side on a workshop table. One minimalist Japanese-inspired — a simple stoneware bowl, chopsticks on a rest, a single cherry blossom branch. One Mediterranean — a painted blue and white plate, an olive branch, a small dish of oil, bright yellow napkin. One modern and bold — a matte black plate, a geometric brass candle holder, a deep red napkin, a succulent. One vintage romantic — a floral patterned plate, a pink peony in a bud vase, a lace-trimmed napkin, a vintage spoon. All beautiful, all different, all personal. Scissors, twine, and clipped greenery scattered between. It shows range. Bright even daylight. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Related Card — Events** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 35mm f/2.8. A dinner table at dusk, lanterns and candles glowing, people mid-conversation — hands gesturing, a glass being lifted, no one aware of the camera. Colorful table with patterned textiles. Shot from the end looking down. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## TABLESCAPES PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 60vh)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 24mm f/4, slightly elevated, of a long table set outdoors under a canopy of trees, late afternoon. The table is a feast for the eyes — a hand-dyed ombre table runner that shifts from terracotta to dusty rose. Plates alternate between matte white and deep olive green. Colored glass goblets in amber, green, and clear. Tall taper candles in ceramic holders glazed in different earth tones. Down the center: a wild, organic floral arrangement — not formal, more like someone raided a garden — dahlias, Queen Anne's lace, trailing vines, berry branches. Wooden serving boards between the flowers. The chairs are mismatched — some rattan, some painted wood in faded colors. The landscape visible through the trees — a field, a distant hill. No people. Late light, long shadows, warm glow through the leaves. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Curated Dinner Experiences** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 35mm f/2.8 from a seated guest's perspective. A dinner table mid-meal. The table stretching away is alive — a big tagine with the lid off, steam rising. Flatbreads piled on a wooden board. Small bowls of bright condiments — harissa, yogurt, pickled onions in magenta. Colored glass tumblers in teal and amber. A hand-painted ceramic serving bowl. Cloth napkins in deep saffron, crumpled and used. Half-eaten plates. Wine and sparkling water in different bottles. Hands across the table reaching for things. Candles in small vintage glass holders — not matching. The room is warm — could be a dining room, a covered patio. Warm candlelight mixed with ambient light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Seasonal Table Settings** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Overhead shot at 50mm f/4 looking straight down. A table set for four, each place setting telling a different season on the same warm wood base. Summer: a bright yellow linen napkin, a turquoise plate, a glass of rosé, sliced peach on the plate, fresh mint. Autumn: a burnt orange velvet napkin, a deep brown stoneware plate, a small gourd, dried wheat stalks, a glass of red wine. Winter: a dark green linen napkin, a charcoal plate, an evergreen sprig, a cinnamon stick, mulled wine in a clear glass. Spring: a lavender napkin, a cream plate with a hand-painted floral edge, a small bunch of sweet peas, a glass of white wine. Down the center, a long wooden board with candles and seasonal elements connecting them. Soft overhead daylight. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Wine & Story Evenings** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/1.8, intimate and close. An intimate corner of a table — two glasses of natural wine (one amber, one deep ruby), a slate board with a wedge of blue cheese, honeycomb, fig halves, and walnuts. A small ceramic dish of olives. A beeswax taper in a vintage brass chamberstick casting a pool of warm light. A few conversation cards scattered — hand-printed on thick dark paper with gold ink. A wool blanket draped over the arm of a chair in frame. The people are soft and blurred but present — you can see hands, a sleeve, someone's shoulder. The mood is close, quiet, real. Low warm light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Accordion — Bespoke Tasting Events** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/3.5, slightly above, looking down the spread. A tasting spread arranged along a long wooden table. Each station is a small world: one with three olive oils in small ceramic dishes with bread for dipping and a handwritten tasting card. Another with honey varieties drizzled on small spoons with cheese pairings. Another with chocolate squares on a slate board with fruit. Another with small glasses of different teas with dried herb samples. The variety is the visual — different textures, colors, vessels at each station. Colored linen squares under each station — a different hue at every stop. A hand reaching for one of the chocolate squares. Warm overhead light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Related Card — Products** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 85mm f/1.8. A tight shot of product details on a shelf — a matte black ceramic bowl, folded plum linen, a glowing candle in amber glass, a small copper dish. Beautiful objects, shallow depth of field, varied materials. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## PRODUCTS PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 60vh)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 28mm f/4 of a curated product display on a long wooden surface against a warm plaster wall. The range is visible and varied: matte black ceramics next to speckled cream ones, folded linens in sage, plum, and saffron, candles in different vessels — amber glass, raw clay, a small copper cup. Letterpress cards in a wooden tray. A gift box in deep green. A jar of honey with a wax-dipped lid. Dried florals in a tall stoneware vase. The objects are beautiful and high quality but not uniform — each one has its own character. Plants mixed in. Soft directional light from the left. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Product Card — The Table Collection** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.8, slight overhead angle. A table collection arrangement on warm wood. A stack of ceramic plates — charcoal, cream, and terracotta — beside folded napkins in indigo and sage. A copper candle holder with a half-burned taper next to a small stoneware pitcher. Wooden salad servers crossed casually. A bowl of flaky salt. A cutting board with a torn pomegranate for color. The pieces are varied — not a matching set, but a curated collection. The quality is visible in the glazes, weave, and patina. Warm side light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Product Card — Stationery Suites** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: Overhead at 50mm f/3.5, flat lay. Letterpress stationery on textured linen. Thick cotton invitation with deep-pressed terracotta ink overlapping a menu card in forest green. A name card in aged gold calligraphy. Torn deckled edges. A brass wax seal, twine, and a vintage pen. The press texture is visible in the paper — deep and tactile. A stick of burgundy sealing wax and a small dried flower pressed flat add color. Warm diffused daylight. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Product Card — Gift Boxes** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.4, slightly above. A curated gift box open on a surface, tissue paper in aged parchment pulled back. The contents are eclectic and beautiful: a candle in a ridged amber glass jar, linen napkins in a deep plum tied with leather cord, a small jar of honey, a hand-stamped wooden spoon, a letterpress card in terracotta. Dried orange slices and a cinnamon stick as filler. Deep green box. The setting is simple — a table, a counter — but the gift is clearly special. Warm afternoon light. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Product Card — Seasonal Editions** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 85mm f/2, tight and moody. A seasonal collection arranged on dark wood. Autumn edition: a candle in a deep amber ceramic vessel, cloth napkins in burgundy and burnt sienna tied with a dried wheat stalk, a small jar of spiced honey with a wax-dipped lid, a letterpress card in forest green, a small ceramic vase with dried hydrangea and bittersweet berries in orange. A halved persimmon and a few scattered walnuts. Rich, warm, tactile. The light is moody, raking from one side. Shot tight so the textures and colors fill the frame. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

---

**Featured Collection Image** (1:1 square)
PROMPT: Shot at 85mm f/2, centered, minimal. A single handmade ceramic vessel centered on a linen surface. The glaze is striking — a deep midnight blue that breaks to warm bronze at the rim and handles, with visible throwing marks and an irregular lip. A single dried stem — a banksia pod or a branch of dried berries — leans in the vessel. The background is soft and warm, out of focus. One beautiful object, simply lit. Warm directional light from one side creating a soft shadow. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

## CONNECT PAGE

**Page Hero** (21:9 wide, 40vh shorter)
PROMPT: A wide, quiet shot at 28mm f/4 of a patio table set and waiting — no people. A round table with a pale linen cloth, four different colored plates at each setting, water glasses turned upside down, cloth napkins in a soft stack, a small arrangement of garden flowers in a ceramic pitcher, a few candles in mixed holders — unlit. Two wicker chairs and a wooden bench. A potted olive tree in the corner. The patio has warm stone or tile, a low wall with climbing vines. Morning light, soft and gentle. The table says "I've been thinking about you." High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Glass & Greenery Outdoor Dinner** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A long outdoor dinner table on a manicured lawn at blue hour, shot at 35mm f/2.8 from the end looking down its length. The table is set entirely in glass and crystal — clear glass charger plates, cut-glass water goblets, slender champagne flutes catching the last blue light, glass votive holders with flickering tea lights running down the center. White linen napkins folded sharp, not knotted. Polished silver flatware. A low runner of dense white flowers — garden roses, ranunculus, jasmine — woven with trailing ivy, kept tight and architectural. The chairs are white Chiavari. String lights overhead in clean parallel lines. Eight guests seated — someone lifting a glass mid-toast, another leaning in to hear over the conversation, a woman laughing with her hand on her chest. A server in a black apron pouring from a wine bottle wrapped in white linen. The grass is perfect. The light is that deep twilight blue with warm candleglow on the table. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Seattle Coffee Shop — Hosted Gathering** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A gathering inside a moody Seattle coffee shop, shot at 28mm f/2.8. Exposed brick walls, a long concrete bar top, industrial pendant lights with Edison bulbs casting amber pools. A group of twelve seated on mismatched stools and mid-century chairs pulled up to a communal table made from reclaimed Douglas fir. The table has pour-over coffee setups at each place — ceramic drippers on glass carafes, small bags of single-origin beans with hand-stamped labels. A barista behind the bar mid-pour, kettle tilted at a precise angle. Pastries from a local bakery on a black slate board — cardamom buns, almond croissants, fruit danishes. Each seat has a small card with a conversation prompt printed on craft paper. Rain streaking the tall windows behind. One person reading their card out loud, another cupping their mug with both hands, someone pulling apart a pastry without looking at it. A chalkboard menu on the wall, half in frame. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Fine Dining — Hospitality Training in Session** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: The dining room of an upscale restaurant during a pre-service training, shot at 40mm f/3.2. White tablecloths on round tables, each set with bone china, crystal stemware, and polished silverware in precise formation. A manager in a tailored vest standing at one table demonstrating a place setting — repositioning a bread plate with two fingers, explaining the geometry. Six servers in crisp white shirts gathered around watching, some holding notepads. One server at a neighboring table practicing — adjusting a wine glass, checking the spacing with their hand. A sommelier in the background decanting red wine into a crystal carafe, backlit by a large window. The room is elegant — dark wood paneling, brass sconces, white molding. A printed training guide sits on the bar behind them. One server's pen is behind their ear. No guests yet — the restaurant is theirs. Bright natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Urban Rooftop Dinner — Modern Minimalist** (21:9 wide)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 24mm f/4 of a rooftop dinner setup at sunset in a city — skyline visible in the background, slightly out of focus. A long steel-frame table with a polished concrete top. The settings are modern and deliberate — square matte white plates, black linen napkins, brushed steel flatware, smoked glass tumblers. Down the center: a low line of succulents in black geometric planters alternating with small concrete candle holders — simple white pillar candles. No flowers. Menu cards printed on translucent vellum at each seat. The chairs are black metal with leather cushions. A portable bar cart to one side with a cocktail setup — copper shaker, cut crystal mixing glass, citrus on a small marble board. The sky is streaked pink and gold. Two people arriving at the far end, one pulling out a chair. The city hums behind. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Hotel Lobby Bar — Workshop Happy Hour** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.4 in a boutique hotel lobby bar. A cocktail-making workshop in progress — a bartender behind a marble-topped bar demonstrating a technique, muddling herbs in a mixing glass. Eight participants on the guest side, each with their own station setup: a small wooden cutting board, a jigger, fresh herbs, citrus halves, and a recipe card printed on heavy black stock with gold text. Some people mid-attempt — one squeezing a lime, another shaking a tin with poor form but full commitment, someone tasting their creation with a skeptical look. The space is polished — dark green leather banquettes, brass bar rail, geometric tile floor, backlit bottle shelves. Cocktail napkins in deep navy at each spot. A bowl of Marcona almonds and marinated olives between stations. Warm amber bar light mixed with cool daylight from the entrance. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Coastal Cliffside Dinner** (21:9 wide)
PROMPT: A wide shot at 24mm f/5.6 of a dinner table set on a grassy bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean at golden hour. A weathered teak table — long and narrow. The settings lean nautical but refined: white enamelware plates with navy rims, clear glass tumblers, linen napkins in faded blue and white stripe, rope-wrapped candle holders with beeswax pillars. The centerpiece is driftwood branches laid flat with small glass bottles holding single stems — sea lavender, white cosmos, dried grasses. A big enameled pot of cioppino in the center, lid off, steam catching the light. A basket of sourdough wrapped in cloth. The ocean is visible behind, waves breaking white against dark rocks. Wind bending the candle flames. Hair moving. A jacket draped over the back of a chair. No one sitting yet — two people approaching from a path at the edge of frame, carrying wine bottles. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Restaurant Pre-Service — The Intention Briefing** (4:3 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 50mm f/2.8 in a warmly lit restaurant before doors open. The full front-of-house staff — twelve people — standing in a loose circle near the bar, some leaning against tables, one sitting on a bar stool. A floor manager holding a clipboard, talking. The tables behind them are fully set and waiting — white napkins fanned in wine glasses, candles unlit, menus stacked. A whiteboard or easel in frame with handwritten notes: "TONIGHT: Anniversary table 4 — married 40 yrs. Birthday dessert table 9. First-time guest table 7 — allergies noted." A server reading the board, arms crossed. Another tying their apron. Someone adjusting a chair at a table in the background without being asked. A tray of espresso cups on the bar — the team's pre-shift coffee. The feeling is focused, professional, intentional. Warm interior light. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Greenhouse Brunch** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: A brunch inside a glass greenhouse or conservatory, shot at 35mm f/3.2. Iron-framed glass walls and ceiling with plants climbing the structure — fig trees, trailing pothos, ferns on high shelves. A long zinc-topped table down the center. The settings mix industrial and garden: brushed metal charger plates, clear pressed-glass juice tumblers, simple white porcelain bowls, cotton napkins in pale blush rolled and tucked with a sprig of fresh mint. The food is bright and abundant — a sheet pan of roasted tomatoes and eggs, a tower of ricotta pancakes dusted with powdered sugar, a glass pitcher of fresh orange juice beading with condensation, a big bowl of mixed berries. A French press and a small ceramic creamer. Eight people seated, some just arriving — one pulling off a jacket, another already eating, someone pouring juice for the person next to them. Light pouring through the glass in every direction, dappled by leaves. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Food Hall Pop-Up — Elevated Street Food Dinner** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 28mm f/2.8 inside a modern food hall or converted warehouse space. A long shared table made from a repurposed industrial door on steel sawhorses. The settings are intentionally casual but considered — heavy kraft paper as a table runner, stainless steel camping plates, pint glasses, black metal flatware, paper napkins in a deep burgundy fanned at each seat. The food is street-food elevated: bao buns stacked in bamboo steamers, tacos on small steel trays lined with wax paper, a big bowl of elote with chili and lime, skewers on a long metal tray, small dishes of pickled daikon and fermented hot sauce. Neon signage on the brick wall behind — a word or shape, out of focus and glowing pink. Concrete floors. A DJ booth in the far corner. Twenty people at the table, crowded, loud, alive — someone reaching across for a steamer, two people clinking pint glasses, a person photographing their plate from above. Warm tungsten light mixed with the neon glow. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.

**Mountain Lodge — Winter Gathering** (16:10 landscape)
PROMPT: Shot at 35mm f/2.8 inside a mountain lodge or large cabin. A massive rough-hewn timber table near a stone fireplace — fire burning, logs stacked beside it. The table is set for a winter dinner: heavy stoneware plates in charcoal and cream, hammered copper mugs, thick-stemmed red wine glasses, flannel napkins in a buffalo check. Down the center: a long iron candelabra with dripping taper candles, pine boughs, pinecones, and small glass jars of cranberries. A cast-iron Dutch oven on a trivet, lid cracked to show braised short ribs. A wooden board with a whole round of baked brie, crackers fanned around it, a small pot of fig jam. Outside the tall windows: snow on evergreen branches, blue winter twilight. Inside: warm orange firelight and candle glow. Ten people at the table — heavy sweaters, wool, someone in a vest. One person ladling from the Dutch oven, another breaking bread, someone warming their hands on a copper mug. A pair of boots by the fire. Documentary style, candid, unposed. High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.
