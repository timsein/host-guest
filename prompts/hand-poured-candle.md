# Hand-Poured Candle — Product Shot

## Subject Prompt

A hand-poured soy candle in a handmade ceramic vessel with an uneven terracotta glaze, sitting on a worn wooden cutting board on a styled tabletop. The candle is lit, with a small soft flame and a thin wisp of smoke curling upward. Beside it, a folded linen napkin in sage green and a small bundle of dried lavender tied with twine. The background is a blurred warm-toned plaster wall. Late golden hour light catching the smoke and casting long, soft shadows across the surface. The scene feels intimate, quiet, and intentional — like the opening moment of a dinner party before guests arrive.

## Film + Edit Prompt

High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.
