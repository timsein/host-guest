# The Table Collection — Product Shot

## Subject Prompt

A richly layered tablescape shot from above at a slight angle. The centerpiece is a hand-thrown stoneware plate with an irregular rim and a reactive glaze that shifts from charcoal to terracotta. A hand-dyed indigo linen napkin with visible raw selvedge edge is folded loosely beside it, a hammered brass fork resting on top. A cluster of mismatched patinated brass candleholders — one tall, one short, one oxidized green — hold beeswax taper candles burned down to different heights, wax pooled and dripped onto the table. A hand-poured candle in a rough-hewn stone vessel smolders nearby. The table itself is reclaimed wood with visible grain, knots, and imperfections. Scattered with intention: a torn pomegranate with seeds spilling out, a small bowl of marinated olives glistening with oil, a hand-stamped ceramic salt cellar, and heavy amber glass tumblers half-filled with something dark. A single stem of dried protea lays across a stack of mismatched vintage plates. The whole scene has a sense of abundance and warmth — a table set by someone who cares deeply about every detail but would never want it to look precious. Warm late afternoon light streaming in from the right, catching the brass and the pomegranate seeds, casting long golden shadows.

## Film + Edit Prompt

High quality photograph with natural warm lighting.
