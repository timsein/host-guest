# The Host and The Guest

## We bring hospitality to life

The Host and The Guest brings hospitality to life  
through event consultation, product design,  
curated workshops, and tablescape styling that  
tells a story.

Many hosts focus on impressing their guests  
with décor, food, and entertainment. Our  
approach is different.

We believe hospitality inspires change. When  
guests experience genuine hospitality, they  
leave deeply impacted by the entire offering.

We partner with hosts to design and deliver  
high-impact gatherings defined by meaningful,  
intentional hospitality.

## Every event can tell a story

We collaborate with clients  
to create experiences that  
leave a lasting impact from  
intimate dinner parties to  
conferences, weddings, and  
corporate events.

We design products to help  
people tell stories, connect  
meaningfully, and notice the  
good around them..

We teach workshops  
tailored to your industry and  
context to equip your team  
for the practice of  
hospitality.

We curate experiences  
“around the table” that  
capture a desired feel and  
effect for the guests.
